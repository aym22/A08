<p>Making stuff is a brilliant life skill! The Maker movement has tapped in to children's desire to create stuff, incorporating technology. Robotics for kids is booming. It's the modern equivalent of knitting circles and sheds at the bottom of the garden. Being able to make things that solve a real world problem, entertain people or just for the joy of making them is a fantastic skill to have. Having robotics as a skill that can be put to useful and creative purposes is fantastic.</p>
